<p>This figure visualizes the mechanical responses (bending moment) on a rat whisker when the whisker contacts various vertical pegs surrounding the rat. The ranges of pegs reached by each whisker are intuitively visible. It also provides intuition for the magnitude and direction each whisker undergoes when it reaches each peg.</p>

<h2 id="moment-location-mappings-in-different-whisking-conditions">Moment-location mappings in different whisking conditions</h2>
<p>This figure shows the location of pegs a whisker is able to reach, as well as how a rat may detect locations based on pairs of bending moment on its whiskers. It is obvious that the top row of dotted plots covers the largest spread of x-y values. The first panel also illustrates physically accurate trajectories of whisker movement.</p>

<h2 id="rat-whisker-properties-by-whisker-identity">Rat whisker properties by whisker identity</h2>
<p>This figure illustrates how the array of whiskers on each rat’s face (similar to human’s five fingers) vary in geometric and mechanical properties. It also includes comparisons of experimentally measured vs. statistically predicted properties. Various trends of y varying with x are observed (e.g. piece-wise increase, decrease, plateau).</p>
