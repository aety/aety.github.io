<p>This figure visualizes the mechanical responses (bending moment) on a rat whisker when the whisker contacts various vertical pegs surrounding the rat. The ranges of pegs reached by each whisker are intuitively visible. It also provides intuition for the magnitude and direction each whisker undergoes when it reaches each peg.</p>
