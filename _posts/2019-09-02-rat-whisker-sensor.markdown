This post introduces a micro-sensor using rat whiskers, developed in collaboration with [Dr. Sarah Bergbreiter](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/bergbreiter-sarah.html)'s group (then) in U of Maryland, College Park, during my PhD.

Presented at [2018 7th IEEE International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8487886), Aug 2018, Enschede, Netherlands.
